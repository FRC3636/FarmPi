## About FarmPi

The idea of FarmPi is to create an easy to use Raspberry Pi image for [OctoFarm](https://octofarm.net){:target="_blank"}. Using this image you could be up and running with your OctoFarm within minutes. The OctoFarm software is created by [James Mackay](https://github.com/NotExpectedYet){:target="_blank"} and [David Zwart](https://github.com/davidzwa){:target="_blank"}. The FarmPi image is created by me, [Maurice Kevenaar](https://github.com/mkevenaar){:target="_blank"}.

FarmPi uses the idea behind [OctoPi](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi){:target="_blank"} using [CustomPiOs](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS){:target="_blank"} by [Guy Sheffer (guysoft)](https://github.com/guysoft){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to sponsor FarmPi, have a look at our [GitHub](https://github.com/mkevenaar/FarmPi){:target="_blank"} for sponsor links. If you want to sponsor OctoFarm look at their [sponsorship](https://octofarm.net/sponsorship){:target="_blank"} page on their website.
